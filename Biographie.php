                    <h1><u>Sung-Jin-Woo</u></h1>
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Appearance: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Prior to his Reawakening, Jin-Woo was a young man of average height with long black hair and grey
                    eyes; his build was frail, and despite being considered stronger than an ordinary human, he was the
                    weakest among Hunters. Before the D-Rank Dungeon Incident, he wore a gray hoodie and brown
                    undershirt alongside blue jeans.
                    <br><br>
                    After his Reawakening as a Player, Jin-Woo was able to grow stronger by increasing his stats, which
                    led to a sudden change to his whole stature/appearance.
                    <br><br>
                    Because of this, he grew a few inches taller; his facial features became a lot sharper, and he
                    gained a lean/muscular build. His whole demeanor also became more serious and intimidating. When
                    fighting enemies or when in use of his powers, Jin-Woo's eyes glow of a pale blue. In some cases, an
                    ominous aura seeps from Jin-Woo alongside dark lightning. This is displayed in moments when Jin-Woo
                    is enraged, such as when he killed the Lizards during the Dungeons & Lizards Arc.
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Woo notably comments that his rapid growth and physical changes may be due to the effects of the
                    System as he increases his stats.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Personality: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Before his Reawakening, Jin-Woo was a kind, nervous, and very timid young man. Despite being so, he
                    respected his fellow Hunters and was brave enough to continue fighting in Dungeons to earn money to
                    care for his sister and to pay for his mother's medical bills; despite being the weakest hunter that
                    had existed.
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Woo is also shown to be an intelligent person, being able to stay calm under pressure as he
                    figured out the clues to fighting the boss of the Double Dungeon while most of the experienced
                    hunters in their party panicked and were killed by the statues when they were trying to escape. This
                    also makes him slightly cautious as he hesitated to reveal his growing strength until he was sure he
                    could protect his family.
                    <br><br>
                    After his reawakening, he strives to become a stronger hunter than before. His sole focuses were
                    getting his daily missions done and leveling up via dungeon crawling. He is seen not to be hesitant
                    with his actions and would injure and significantly harm anyone who threatens himself or those he
                    genuinely cares for. Despite this, he is unwilling to draw the shadow of innocent Hunters/civilians.
                    He has only done such rare cases, such as extracting Min Byung-Gyu's shadow to heal Cha Hae-In. He
                    has a great love for those close to him, including his family and close friends such as his sister
                    Sung Jin-Ah whom he attached powerful high orc shadow soldiers to protect her during dangerous
                    situations such as the Orc Gate that opened inside the school she attended.
                    <br><br>
                    He is easily enraged if anyone dear to him was injured or threatened and went to great lengths to
                    protect them, as seen when Hwang Dong-Su kidnapped Yoo Jin-Ho where he fought the entire Scavenger
                    Guild alone for the sake of his dear friend. Although Jin-Woo was shown to be indifferent when it to
                    money, wealth, and even humanly desires, he admitted to inadvertently taking a peek at Hae-In's
                    naked form after unwisely using 'Sensory Sharing' through the Shadow Soldier inserted into her
                    shadow.
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Woo has displayed a substantial increase in confidence after receiving the mysterious 'Double
                    Awakening'. He has become powerful yet maintains a relaxed personality. Jin-Woo does not falter in
                    crisis or a threat and is rarely angered. He has displayed less emotion, which may be caused by the
                    use of the system as mentioned by Jin-Woo himself when he states, "One of my emotions died,"
                    referring to the possibility that the power of the System is affecting him in some way. Despite
                    this, he rarely questions the System and its unknown origins, which are later explained in the
                    story. He also tends to smile when facing a difficult situation and always maintains the confidence
                    of himself coming out on top in the end.
                    <br><br>
                    Even after achieving great power, Jin-Woo does not maintain an aggressive and overconfident against
                    others. He is described by others to be easy to talk to and much more accepting of certain
                    situations he may face. In one instance, two American Hunter Association members pointed guns at
                    Jin-Woo as a result of a misunderstanding. However, Jin-Woo did not use his powers but rather calmly
                    diffused the situation.
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Woo consistently defines his actions by a set of moral codes. He refuses to resurrect innocent
                    humans to serve as shadow soldiers and does everything to protect those weaker than him. Jin-Woo
                    has, on a few occasions, breached such rulers such as in the case of Min Byung-Gyu whose abilities
                    were required to save the dying Cha Hae-In.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Background: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Woo is the eldest child in his family. After his father, Il-Hwan disappeared inside an unknown
                    gate, Jin-Woo took all the responsibilities for his sister, Jin-Ah and Kyung-He, his mother. Both
                    Jin-Woo and his sister have lived in the same house since they were children. Their mother fell
                    victim to the Eternal Sleep Disease leaving Jin-Woo and Jin-Ah all alone for the past 4 years since
                    she fell into a comatose state after contracting the disease.
                    <br><br>
                    He worked as an E-Ranked Hunter under the Korean Hunters Association for 4 years, fighting a daily
                    struggle of life and death as he embarked upon journeys into low-ranked dungeons as the weakest
                    E-Rank hunter simply to support his family in such a time of need. He persevered through such
                    dungeons to pay his mother's medical bills and his younger sister's school fees as he attempted to
                    close the gap left behind by their missing father who disappeared inside a gate while attempting to
                    protect his colleagues.
                    <br><br>
                    After entering a D-Rank dungeon alongside party leader Song Chi-Yul, Jin-Woo came across the Double
                    Dungeon. Surviving the multiple trials within the temple, Jin-Woo ultimately to become a Player and
                    unique Reawakened Hunter that was able to ceaselessly level up with the support of the mysterious
                    System.

                    Sung Jin-Woo (성진우成秦禹) is the protagonist of Solo Leveling. He was previously known as the World's
                    Weakest Hunter and delved down the path of becoming the World's Strongest Hunter after he was
                    Reawakened and became a Player.
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Woo was reawakened as a Player after surviving the Cartenon Temple and completing the secret
                    quest "Courage of the Weak".
                    <br>
                    The mysterious System has allowed Jin-Woo to limitless level up and
                    increases his strength, unlike all hunters, who are unable to increase their strength unless
                    reawakened.

                    <h1><u> Cha Hae-In</u></h1>
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Appearance: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Cha Hae-In sports a blonde short hairstyle where it is cut above the shoulders in a blunt cut and
                    bangs, sometimes she would tie her hair up when gearing up for battle. She has a pointed nose and
                    slanted gray eyes. When in battle, her eyes occasionally glow of a bright gold similar to Goto
                    Ryuji. She was first seen wearing a set of armor for equipment without a helmet and a sword on her
                    waist.
                    <br><br>
                    She wore bronze plated shoulder guards and a black and red collared shirt with white stripes and
                    buttons. She carried a black sword with a silver hilt. During the 4th Jeju Island Raid, she wore
                    gold and red plated armor and carried a sword with a black and gold hilt. It is notable that Jin-Woo
                    stated that he believed Cha Hae-In to be attractive.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Personality: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Cha Hae-In is described as being a workaholic. Prior to the Jeju Island incident, she didn't take a
                    single day of relaxation in her nearly two years of being a hunter; often remaining tense on days
                    she wasn't participating in raids. This was in part due to worry about her colleagues. During the
                    raids, she'd be wary of the mistakes they make. She is an incredibly wary and cautious woman who
                    cares for the safety of those around her as displayed through her habit of monitoring the boss room
                    to prevent it from leaving its nest in the A-Rank Dungeon Jin-Woo entered as a miner.
                    <br><br>
                    She expresses deep anguish and regrets with the death of any of her guild members, feeling
                    distraught with the death of hunters in the Double Dungeon when attempting to save Jin-Woo. Since
                    her meeting with Jin-Woo, her personality has displayed a drastic change. She no longer feels as if
                    she has to meet the expectations of her comrades and feels she could go back to being a regular
                    woman living her life.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>History: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Cha Hae-In was briefly introduced in chapter 28 as a kendo student of Song Chi-Yul and it is
                    remarked as surprising that an S-rank would be taught by a low-Rank like him and though she appears
                    her face is hidden. We see her again briefly introduced by Yoo Myung-Han as one of the top S-Rank
                    hunters in Korea, though again we do not get her full appearance as she appeared only as a
                    silhouette. Her full appearance was seen in the Hunters Guild Gate Arc leaving the dungeon with her
                    co-guild members.
                    <br><br>
                    Hunters Guild Gate Arc
                    She started to feel something was wrong at that moment as she sensed enormous mana which she thought
                    was from Go Gun-Hee when apparently it was from Jin-Woo. When she suddenly came after arousing her
                    curiosity in the gate, she found him about to enter the dungeon.
                    <br><br>
                    After warning him of the danger the dungeon has, she left with thoughts lingering over the brief
                    image of a dagger Jin-Woo was holding. This continued even after coming back home that she decided
                    to go back again in the dungeon only to find out that Jin-Woo joined the attack force of the Hunters
                    Guild. Cha Hae-In went inside the dungeon and seeing S-Rank mobs which the B team fought earlier in
                    the dungeon she rushes to try and save the team only to find out about Jin-Woo's slaughtering. She
                    wasn't able to do anything as Jin-Woo sent her a glare warning her of not intruding. Then, Korean
                    Hunters Association's ace Woo Jin-Chul appeared to escort Jin-Woo out of the dungeon leaving a
                    warning to the surrounding hunters not to talk about what happened in the dungeon and they will
                    understand what happened if they watch the news on TV.
                    <br><br>
                    Jeju Island Arc
                    Cha Hae-In appeared alongside the Korean and Japanese S-Rank hunters in the hunters' gym prior to
                    the 4th Jeju Island Reclamation Raid. After witnessing the duel between Hanekawa and Park Jong-Soo,
                    Goto Ryuji proposed to have a similar duel between S-Rank hunters of Korea and Japan to strengthen
                    bonds between one another. The Korean team comprised of Baek Yoon-Ho, Ma Dong-Wook, Lim Tae-Gyu, and
                    Cha Hae-In while the Japanese team included Atsushi Kumamoto, Kenzo Tanaka, Kanae Tawata and Minoru
                    Hoshino. When the battle commenced, Hae-In focused her attention on the Japanese female hunter,
                    Kanae Tawata and easily defeated her in battle. After touching her back, Hae-In hurried to support
                    Baek Yoon-Ho only to be confronted by Kumamoto. Reacting quickly to his appearance, Cha Hae-In
                    delivered multiple multiple punches aimed at his face. Kumamoto was now angered by her attack and
                    entered his berserk state and aggressively attacked Hae-In. However, before his attack could harm
                    Hae-in, Jin-Woo entered and restrained Kumamoto in a matter of seconds.
                    <br><br>
                    During the raid, The Korean S-Rank Team was tasked with slaying the Ant Queen within the Baengnokdam
                    Crater Lake where the nest was located while the Japanese team had the primary objective of drawing
                    the attention of the hordes of ants on the island. When the 4th Jeju Island Reclamation Raid began,
                    Cha Hae-In and the Korean S-Rank team were brought to the island in a helicopter. Once Choi Jong-In
                    exited the helicopter alone, the group expressed concern to his safety, to which Cha Hae-In replied
                    that he would not be in any serious danger. The Korean team entered the ant tunnel and fought
                    multiple powerful ants before reaching the breeding grounds. Choi Jong-In prepared to burn the eggs
                    before Cha Hae-In directed the team's attention to the sole abnormally large egg that had already
                    hatched. Min Byung-Gyu expressed concern but ignored it as they focused on the primary mission of
                    locating and slaying the queen. Nearing the nest, the group came across the Ant Queen's royal guards
                    who were substantially stronger than soldier ant variants. However, Cha Hae-In was easily able to
                    kill the ones appearing before the group with the support of Ma Dong-Wook's tanking skills.
                    <br><br>
                    Min Byung-Gyu provided specifically targetted buffs to his teammates. Baek Yoon-Ho commented on
                    Hae-In's strength stating that Byung-Gyu's buffs gave her 'wings' as she massacred the royal guard
                    ants that attacked the group.
                    <br><br>
                    As the Ant Queen was nearing death, Cha Hae-In delivered the final blow, slicing the Queen's head
                    off and defeating the dungeon boss. However, the group's celebrations were cut short with the
                    arrival of the Ant King who entered soon after the Queen released a cry for help during its final
                    moments. Hae-In commented on the King's vile scent and immense power. When the King howled, Cha
                    Hae-In was the only one of her team to be left standing. Yet, she was far too weak to attack and was
                    flung into the inner cave walls by a single punch from the King rendering her unconscious for the
                    remainder of the battle.
                    <br><br>
                    When Jin-Woo attempted to heal Hae-In using his healing potions, he realized that he was unable to
                    do so with the system stating that her health was below 10%. Left with no other options, Jin-Woo
                    created a shadow soldier from the corpse of Min Byung-Gyu who was killed by the Ant King and healed
                    Hae-In. She later woke up in the hospital with no injuries as a result of the healing of Byung-Gyu's
                    shadow.

                    <h1><u>Sung Jin-Ah</u></h1>
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Appearance: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Ah has neatly tied light black hair in contrast to her brother who has a darker shade of black.
                    She sometimes wears hair accessories when at home. She wears her school uniform on her weekdays.
                    When wearing her school uniform, she wears a blue jacket, a white collared shirt, and a red tie.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Personality: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    She is a hard-working girl who usually tops her exams and has a close relationship with her brother
                    since they are the only siblings in their family. As she grew with only Jin-Woo next to her with her
                    father got stranded in a gate and her mother ending up in coma due to Eternal Sleep, Jin-Ah was
                    always on the edge whenever Jin-Woo is in the hospital and wanted him to stop being a hunter. She
                    stated that if he injured himself one more time, she would give up her dreams and studies to get a
                    job and support him.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>History: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Reawakening Arc</u></b>
                    <br>
                    Jin-Ah appeared in the hospital room where Jin-Woo was resting, with her friend Han Song-I waiting
                    to her outside. She expressed her disapproval at Jin-Woo's work as a hunter, seeing how he was
                    repeatedly facing life-threatening situations and ending up in a hospital. Later, Jin-Ah would feel
                    the changes surrounding her brother, making her think that it was getting hard to cope up with him.
                    She jokes how her usually stingy brother buys her food, unknown to her that he was trying to get
                    drunk after killing people in the dungeon.[1] Jin-Ah then ended up accompanying Jin-Woo in his
                    exercises not knowing that he was doing his daily quest.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Ahjin Guild Arc: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Guild Naming</u></b>
                    <br>
                    Jin-Woo told Jin-Ah about him creating a guild. He asked her what she thought of the name 'Solo
                    Play'. Jin-Ah laughed, stating that it wasn't a good name. Jin-Ah proposed the name Ahjin which was
                    the reverse of her name. It also meant Ah (我) which means ‘myself’ and Jin (進) which means ‘moving
                    forward’ creating the statement 'I Shall Move Forward'. Jin-Woo accepted this name and named his
                    guild after his sisters recommendation to which Yu Jin-Ho was relieved as he disliked the name
                    Jin-Woo came up with.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>School Attack</u></b>
                    <br>
                    Jin-Ah was at school on a weekday when a gate opened up inside her school. It was covered behind a
                    curtain and opened up once high school boys entered a closet room and discovered it. By this time, a
                    period of 7 days had already been passed and orc monsters poured out of the gate killing the
                    students. The school was thrown into chaos with the magic beasts rampaging within the school. Half
                    of the students in the school had been killed by the orcs. Jin-Ah was on one of the top floors as a
                    result of being a 3rd-year student and was unable to escape the school as a result of her location.
                    Once orcs entered her classroom, they noticed that there was a human emitting magical energy, which
                    was coming from Jin-Ah. The orcs who believed it to be a hunter attacked her swinging their axes at
                    her.
                    <br><br>
                    A black veil of smoke appeared from Jin-Ah as high orcs protected her from the lower orcs attacking
                    her. The high orc threw a single punch, killing the orc attacking Jin-Ah. The three high orcs
                    surrounded her to protect her and killed the two remaining orcs with ease. While Jin-Woo was on a
                    raid with the Knights Guild, Jin-Woo noticed his shadows taking damage. Believing something to have
                    happened, Jin-Woo walked to leave the dungeon as he became worried about her sister's safety.
                    Jin-Woo became enraged at the thought of something happening to his sister. Jin-Woo left Beru and
                    the Shadow Ant Army with Park Jong-Soo to clear the dungeon.
                    <br><br>
                    He rode Kaisel and headed for the location of Jin-Ah's school. The boss of the dungeon, Guroktaru
                    entered and began to attack the High Orcs with all his might. However, no matter how many times the
                    High Orcs were defeated, they would revert to their original state as a result of their status as
                    Shadow Soldiers. The boss grabbed Jin-Ah by the neck and was about to kill her before Kaisel could
                    be heard growling from nearby as Jin-Woo approached the school. Guroktaru began to panic, sensing
                    that if it did not leave it would be killed instantly. He dropped Jin-Ah and ran away from the
                    classroom. Jin-Woo ran to Jin-Ah and asked her if she was alright.
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, she had no injuries except the hand imprint on her neck. Jin-Woo uses his sensory
                    perception and determined only 17 students were alive inside the school. The orcs attacked Jin-Woo
                    despite their immense fear and Jin-Woo grabbed Guroktaru's head and slammed it into the wall. The
                    orc begged for forgiveness and Jin-Woo stated that he would forgive the orc, but the act of
                    forgiving would not be painless.
                    <br><br>
                    When hunters finally arrived at the school, they ran up the stairs and found Jin-Woo standing with
                    the blood of countless orcs holding his blade. Jin-Woo confirmed that his sister had been taken to a
                    nearby hospital and spoke with the association members present at the scene before leaving. After
                    some time had passed since the school attack, Jin-Woo stated that Jin-Ah struggled to maintain her
                    cheery attitude ever since the attack.

                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Appearance: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Yoo Jin-Woo sports custard-colored short hair with a cropped fringe. As comic relief, he is first
                    seen wearing gaudy weapons and equipment, which made him a target of bad guys and would continue to
                    do so in every raid. As a son of a chaebol, he is neatly dressed.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Abilities: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    As an awakened Hunter, Jin-Ho despite being only a D-Rank hunter is stronger than normal humans. To
                    make up for his class, he tends to wear heavier equipment and weapons.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Personality: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Ho has extreme loyalty towards Jin-Woo, which originally stemmed from his fear of Jin-Woo as a
                    suspected False Ranker, a misunderstanding that was never cleared throughout the series. He was a
                    naive hunter who joined a party without thinking ahead. Although naivety gets the best of him, he
                    tends to wear flashy and new equipment as an assurance that irks Jin-Woo even though they would be
                    too heavy for his body.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Story: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Ho first appeared sporting a flashy set of equipment and weapons to which garnered much
                    attention from Jin-Woo and Hwang Dong-Suk's motley party. As the party he joined revealed to be a
                    bunch of examples of 'lizards', Jin-Ho almost died had it not been for Jin-Woo. As Jin-Woo fights,
                    Jin-Ho mistook him as a False Ranker who kills for fun. Thus, he began to treat Jin-Woo with respect
                    and reverence out of fear.
                    <br><br>
                    Jin-Ho continues to be acquainted with Jin-Woo even after the temporary raid party. For the sake of
                    being the guild master of the future Yoojin Guild, he tried to make a bold move towards his father,
                    but his father saw through him. Despite this, however, his father Yoo Myung-Han was impressed by his
                    son's boldness. Jin-Ho was eventually given the rights of the Yoojin Guild even when he couldn't
                    bring Jin-Woo in their guild, but he ended up rejecting the offer of his father, making Myung-Han so
                    angry that he froze his accounts and threw him out of his house. Jin-Ho rejected his father because
                    Jin-Woo said he wanted to create his own guild and suggested that he will make Jin-Ho the Vice-Guild
                    Master.
                    <br><br>
                    Later in the series, Jin-Ho garners much attention as he always accompanies Jin-Woo when they visit
                    various countries, especially since he is the main representative of their guild. Jin-Ho being a
                    D-Rank Hunter both received enmity and awe being next to Jin-Woo

                    Yoo Jin-Ho (유진호兪珍虎) is a D-Rank Hunter that Sung Jin-Woo saved in a C-Rank dungeon. He initially
                    thought of Jin-Woo as a False Ranker and feared him, but quickly started to trust him and has
                    developed massive respect for since then.

                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Appearance: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    Il-Hwan was first seen as a man with untrimmed long, spiky black hair and overly grown bangs that
                    almost covers his eyes and face all over. His clothes were torn like rags and he was barefooted
                    inside the A-Rank dungeon where he first appeared.
                    <br><br>
                    As he was treated like a Human-Type Magic Beast, the Federal Bureau of Hunters gave him orange
                    clothes akin to those worn by prisoners and he was also handcuffed while inside the interrogation
                    room. During the Monarchs War Arc, when he uses the power of the Rulers, he appears wearing a robe
                    and is burning in golden flames.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Personality: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    In the webtoon, Il-Hwan is shown to be easy-going, as he tries to calm the scared American Hunters.
                    In the novel, Il-Hwan is said to be a worry-wart who constantly worries over his children,
                    especially Jin-Woo. He was displayed to be a kind individual who deeply cared for his family and
                    would risk his life to protect his children and those dear to him.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Abilities: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    In the series, Il-Hwan's skills were rarely put on display, but he is estimated to be between S-Rank
                    and National Level Hunters level. This can be deduced by how he was able to defeat Hwang Dong-Su
                    single-handedly, without any injuries and minimal property damage. it was also stated that the magic
                    power radiating from him was equal to an A-rank Gate.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Sense</b> -> His heightened ability enabled him to easily detect the murderous intent emanating
                    from Dong-Su's gaze.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Stealth</b> -> He was able to follow Jin-Woo and observe him without his son nor his Shadows
                    finding out. It was also hinted how he was able to sneak into his wife's hospital room without
                    Jin-Woo knowing.

                    asks her son to promise her that he will take care of his sister and protect her. A promise which
                    even Sung Jin-Woo forgot already but when she woke up, she thanked him deeply for upholding that
                    promise.

                    Her sickness served as the primary motivation for Jin-Woo becoming a hunter alongside his desire to

                    <b><u> D-Rank Dungeon Arc </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    The Statue of God was a creation of the Angel, the architect of the System. The Statue is a mere
                    puppet controlled by the Angel rather than a separate Magic Beast. The Cartenon Temple and Statues
                    were used to implement the plan of the Angel to find a human vessel for the Shadow Monarch's immense
                    powers. This vessel was to be Jin-Woo.
                    <br><br>
                    As Jin-Woo and fellow hunters entered the Cartenon Temple, believing it to be another low-ranked
                    dungeon, the hunters were greeted by the towering Statue of God sitting upon a throne, guarded by
                    other large statues. Unaware of the statues' ability to move, the hunters were startled as a D-Rank
                    hunter was instantly killed after attempting to exit the dungeon.
                    <br><br>
                    As the hunters' panicked, the Statue of God prepared to shoot a ray of light which killed multiple
                    low-ranked hunters on impact, which would have killed more if not for the warning issued by Jin-Woo
                    as he noticed the statue's attack beforehand.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Jin-Woo, remembering the first commandment: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Worship the Lord</b>
                    <br>
                    alerted other hunters to bow down to the Statue of God, in an attempt to survive. After witnessing
                    the hunters bowing down towards itself, the Statue of God formed a maniacal smile and began to
                    suddenly move, before trampling multiple hunters.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>When the second commandment: </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Praise the Lord</b>
                    <br>
                    was fulfilled, the Statue of God ceased its movements as an altar appeared to fulfill the third
                    commandment.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Prove your Faith</b>
                    <br>
                    Once the final commandment was fulfilled and Jin-Woo had accepted his status as a Player, all
                    statues including the Statue of God disappeared once hunters came to investigate the dungeon.
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u> Dungeon Arc </u></b>
                    <br><br>
                    As Jin-Woo reentered the Cartenon Temple, he observed the almost identical interior and acknowledged
                    the statues and Statue of God present from before. However, Jin-Woo stated that none of the statues
                    had a presence or magical energy that he could sense except for the Angel, the puppetmaster of all
                    the statues present in the room.
                    <br><br>
                    Unable to use the strength of his shadow soldiers after it being restricted by the Angel, who
                    designed the system, Jin-Woo was forced to face all the statues and Statue of God alone without help
                    from his shadows. After defeating the Statue of God and other statues using his immense strength,
                    Jin-Woo faced against the Angel in an intense battle in which even Jin-Woo struggled. However, he
                    was ultimately victorious in defeating the Angel after it was betrayed by Ashborn allowing Jin-Woo
                    to attain the Black Heart.

                    The color of the name changes according to the monster's strength :

                    ● White means it is weak
                    ● Orange means it is strong

                    Magic Beasts (마수, Ma-Su) are hostile creatures found in Dungeons and Instant Dungeons. In the
                    Dungeons from the Real World, some higher rank monsters who gained intelligence described that a
                    voice in their head constantly tells them to hunt the humans. In the Instant Dungeons, however, the
                    voice tells them to protect the place they are in.
